<h1>The Best Movies According to Zeynep </h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Insideout</h3>
<p>This is my favourite animation. I love the emotional creativity. I think it's the other way to real life. Also I supported to everybody should watch animations.</p>
<h3>Interstellar</h3>
<p>Really cool sci-fi movie. When I first watched, I was feeling really exciting during the meeting his daughter. Ups! I shouldn't share spoiler.</p>
<h3>Truman Show</h3>
<p>Super beautiful film. Really artistic. There's so different perspective. I think imadiatly everybody should watch. </p>
